  Hey you found me! I'm Mickey Pashov!üëã 
</p>

I'm a developer living in London. I moved here about 2 years ago from bonnie Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†ÅøÛ†Å¥!

I moved to join an early-stage [fast-growing startup](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/23/customer-marketing-platform-ometria-raises-21m-series-b-round-led-by-octopus-ventures/) called [Ometria](https://ometria.com).
There I met loads of great people and got to learn about and build cool things!
There is a laundry list of technologies I got to touch but the highlights include [Python](https://python.org) üêç, 
Kubernetes, AWS and most recently [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) ‚ùÑÔ∏è .

Before that, I worked for one of the [**biggest banks in the world**](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/2d96e1cf-0805-4cd6-82e9-82dfd00a3dba.pdf) - [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) üè¶ .
This was my foray into enterprise software engineering! I started working on some old-school monitoring using Java and 
moved into the Cloud, building Python microservices and learning the ins and outs of Unix and infrastructure.

Going back even further I was a student at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), the [**fourth oldest university in the UK**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_university)!

I started my journey at the university doing a BSc in Psychology Hons with a combination of Computing Science.
At the time of my graduation, Glasgow was ranked [**top 5 in the UK for psychology**](https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2013/jun/04/university-guide-psychology). My focus at the time was cognitive psychology, and 
[computational neuroscience](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/teaching/undergraduate/) where I scored in the **85th percentile of exam results**.

I was later awarded a vacation scholarship at the [School of Information Retrieval](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/). Followed by an MSc in Information Technology where I got to learn all about 
best practices in software development.

It all started for me in Sofia, Bulgaria where I used to play around on my friend's computers!
