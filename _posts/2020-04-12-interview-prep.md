title: Interview prep
excerpt: 
---

As software engineers our environment is ever changing. Things are moving fast. "Once in a lifetime" events seem to happen every couple of years now. That's why I think one needs to stay sharp and interview at regular intervals.

### Hiring platforms:
- [Otta](https://app.otta.com/sign-up?referral=YnN4YnFP) - my personal favourite. Great companies, great UI/UX, well curated content.
- [Hired](https://hired.com/x/1fl7e) - if you're looking for startups and FANG companies you've already heard of them. The model here is companies reach out to you.
- [StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/) - I haven't extensively used it but I think any self-respecting engineering org should post their jobs on here as well.
- [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com/) - only available in the US. But you can still take the quiz! Somehow I was in the 83 percentile when I did it. I must be good at guessing.

### Coding prep:
- [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com/) - loads of problem sets and active community. Read about it on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-better-HackerRank-or-LeetCode).
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - I think it has more practice questions than LeetCode but it's not the community favourite.
- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/) - if you've been on YouTube for any period of time you must have seen the adverts.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - if you're hardcore and serious about the coding challenges you do.
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) - haven't personaly used it but it's questions can get repetative.
- [Geektastic](https://app.geektastic.com/register?utm_source=devref&utm_campaign=kD_tRUQ5AOWT1p6voKKRJA&utm_medium=site#hirer) - It's not as slick as everything else but some companies use it so you might as well familiarise yourself. If you use this link you will get **50%** your first 3 months.

### Coferences:

This will sort of depend on your specialisation. Also they can get quite pricey so if you'd like to attend just volunteer! Here are the ones I like:
- [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) - I've attended the UK one, but the one in the US is much bigger.
- [goto;](https://blog.gotocon.com/) - volunteered for this one a couple of years ago, it was great!
- [QCon](https://qconlondon.com/) - another massive conference, which I volunteered for.

### Books and blogs:
- [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://amzn.to/2Vh2v4M) - this comes highly recommended!
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2RQQRvA) - very famous book but also very dense.
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://amzn.to/2VjqAbi) - popular yet still quite lengthy.
- [Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people](https://amzn.to/2RNGI2N) - very light weight way of learning about algorithms

- [HighScalability Blog](http://highscalability.com/)
- [Arden Dertat's Programming interview questions](http://www.ardendertat.com/2012/01/09/programming-interview-questions/)

### YouTube:

I love spending my time on Youtube, that's how I get most of my information these days. But it's very important that you actually do prep questions rather that watch these videos for hours (speaking from experience).
- [Joma Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0qA-eDDICsRR9rPcnG7tw) - very entertaining and informative
- [TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw) - I used to love his content now I'm a bit more wary of it.
- [Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw) - outstanding videos on interview prep and system design. The images in this post are from his video.
- [Cl√©ment Mihailescu (AlgoExpert)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g) - his content is also quite good but I've got brand loyalty to Joma and TechLead, they can be a bit more entertaining.
- [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) - haven't watched his content in a while but he's got some solid explanation videos. Most everyone else has put their explanations behind a paywall.
