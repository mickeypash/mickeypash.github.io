title: Exhaustive list of books to read
---

![](images/books.jpeg)

Over the last year I've been compiling a list of books that my colleagues and friends have either, bought, read or recommended.
It'a huge list and in no particular order, apart from the first book which is a fan favourite!
The checkboxes represent that I either own it, have skimmed it or found it online.
Apologies for any typos. I'll try to refine the list and add links
