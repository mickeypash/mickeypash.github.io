![books]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/books.jpeg)

Over the last year I've been compiling a list of books that my colleagues and friends have either, bought, read or recommended.
The checkboxes represent that I either own it, have skimmed it or found it online.
Why not pick one of them up while you have the time? (As of writing this we are still in the early days of COVID-19 lockdown)

I have defined a top 5 list:

1. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Systems](https://amzn.to/2V7hwoN)
2. [Software Engineering at Google](https://amzn.to/2UHBbMM)
3. [Database Internals](https://amzn.to/3aOHGTK)
4. [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://amzn.to/2JEYIaT)
5. [An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management](https://amzn.to/3aIcVQs)
