title: Impossible list
---

Inspired by Thomas Frank's [impossible list](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/)
which in turn was inspired by Joel Runyon the creator of the *IMPOSSIBLE* list and defined the [difference between it and a bucket list](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/)

I will add certain things retroactively as a reminder of my achievements. 
They will serve as a launch point for my new goals and achievements
