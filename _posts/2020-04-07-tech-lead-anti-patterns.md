title: Tech Lead Anti-patterns

![](images/tech-lead.jpg)

Sometime ago I watched a talk on [People First Engineering Management @ Monzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqkHQA7XM0).
It's full of really interesting and insightful content but my biggest takeaway was the following the tech load anti-patterns.

Let's use Monzo's definition of a **Tech lead** first:
- A fairly experienced engineer
- Who is still working as an individual contributor and writing code.
- And wears a hat 👒 (this is not a role or a progression level)

They are expected to:
- Pair with the product manager on the squad's success
- Provide technical context and direction
- Enable and empower other engineers
- Foster effective collaboration
- Won't necessarily be a tech lead forever

Now that we have this in mind here are the patterns:

- The Faux PM 👩🏻‍🏫
    * Tries to get involved by prioritising the backlog
    * Doing their own research
    * Writing their own tickets (team's tickets)
    * Finding features on their own
- The Dictator 👮🏻‍♂️
    * This is where they define the scope of the project and hand it off to somebody else
    * Over specifying and not doing any implementation themselves
    * Only ever doing the most interesting work
- The Martyr 🧝🏻‍♀️
    * Tries to do everything, all the small and boring tasks
    * Working late, trying to save the day, so no one else has to
    * Not knowing when to delegate
- The Over-Empathiser 👩🏽‍⚕️
    * Not giving constructive feedback
    * Not holding people to account
    * Fixing other people's code themselves
