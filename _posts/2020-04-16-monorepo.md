There has been a renewed buzz about monorepos recently.
First of all there was that [announcement](https://github.blog/2020-01-13-highlights-from-git-2-25/
) from Github about `git sparse-checkout`, an experimental feature in Git 2.25.0 that simplifies the process of partially dowloading a large repository, saving space and improving the performance. I suspect this feature was driven by the growing popularity of of the "microservices in a monorepo".

Second, the new [Software Engineering at Google](https://amzn.to/2RKSkDA) book was recently released and it often references both the benefits and disadvantages to monorepos.

Over the last couple of years I experienced projects where monorepos organically came into being or were explicitly selected for. Similarly to many others out there I came to the same conclusions in terms of their advantages:
- **Sharing dependencies, means managing less** - if several services depend on eachother but are in the same repository you have the same version number so it's less likely to encounter issues.
- **No more cross-repo changes** - many features I've had to implement, crossed service boundries and would require additional steps (cloning, checkingout, switching contexts), but with a monorepo it's all in one place so you could make the change in a single commit.
- **Seeing the bigger picture** - if services from the same domain are centralised in a monorepo it's much easier for someone to understand how they are related, rather than doing haphazard Github searches.
