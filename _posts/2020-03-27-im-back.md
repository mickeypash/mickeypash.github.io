No idea how long this will continue for but since we are all working 
from home during this COVID-19 epidemic. I thought I might as well try to add some content on here.

I started by registering the `mickey.sh` domain name, I'm a developer after all üë®‚Äçüíª.
Got it discounted on Namecheap with the use of the Honey Chrome extension.

Decided to stick with the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme for now. I spent quite a while updating the configuration but it finally works! Although I am currently considering using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosting it via Netlify.

Added a few words about myself on my [about](/about) page.
