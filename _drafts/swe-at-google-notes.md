### The three pillars if building a good team

**Pillar 1: Humility**
    - You are not the center of the universe (or your code). You're neigher omnicient nor infallible. You're open to self-improvement.
**Pillar 2: Respect**
    - You genuinely care about others you work with. You tread them kindly and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
**Pillar 3: Trust** 
    - You believe other are competent and will do the right thing, and you're OK with letting them drive when appropriate.
