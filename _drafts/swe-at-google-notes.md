# Software Engineering at Google

### The three pillars if building a good team

**Pillar 1: Humility**
    - You are not the center of the universe (or your code). You're neigher omnicient nor infallible. You're open to self-improvement.
**Pillar 2: Respect**
    - You genuinely care about others you work with. You tread them kindly and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
**Pillar 3: Trust** 
    - You believe other are competent and will do the right thing, and you're OK with letting them drive when appropriate.

### What it means to be "Googley" and why Google doens't use this term anymore
- Thrives in ambiguity
  * Can deal with conflicting messages or directions, build consensus, make progress against a problem, even when the environment is consistently shifting.
- Values feedback
- Challenges status quo
- Puts the user first
- Cares about the team
- Does the right thing

### Cycle of success
- Analysis
- Struggle
- Tracion
- Reward

### How to work on important things rather than urgent things
- Delegate
- Schedule dedicated time
- Find a tracking system that works

### Protect your
- Time
- Attention
- Energy!
  * Take real vacations
  * Make it trivial to disconnect
  * Take real weekends too
  * Take breaks during the day
  * Give yourself permission to take a mental health day

- Always Be Deciding: Ambiguous problems have no magic answer; they're all about finding the right *trade-offs* of the moment, and iterating.
- Alwasy Be Leaving: Your job, as a leader, is to build an organisation that automatically solves a class of ambigous problems -over time- without you needing to be present.
- Always Be Scaling: Success geneartes more responsibility over time, and you must proactively manager the *scaling* of this work in order to protect your scarce resources of personal time, attention and energy.
